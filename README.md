**1) My publication** 

I added the review my team and I worked on and got published. In summary, the paper explains why it is important to bring data science into Live-cell imaging and we explain topics such as clustering, supervised and unsupervised learning or some concepts from deep learning. 

**2) Poster** 

This is the summary of an extensive job I did in collaboration with some scientists from different Research Centers from the University of Costa Rica. We studied the damage of some paintings from the National Theater of Costa Rica. In order to understand that, I did image analysis using ImageJ, extracted and analyzed the data, applied different statistical concepts and presented my conclusions, which you can see here.
