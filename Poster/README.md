I create this poster as a result of an investigation I performed on two paintings located at the National Theater of Costa Rica. The data was obtained by performing image analysis on ImageJ.

I developed a method of measuring some physical variables on the images taken by different microscopy techniques. The data was analyzed by different statistical parameters.
